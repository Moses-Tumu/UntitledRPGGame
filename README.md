# Untitled RPG Game

This is an untitled 2D rpg game I am making in Unity.

It will be a very simple game so that I can learn more with Unity and 2D game.
It is mainly for me to know the basics and more.
There will just be a magic system and a basic inventory.

I am using Unity as the Game Engine with other tools like Rule Tile and more.
